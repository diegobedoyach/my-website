# Personal Website Using GitHub Pages

This repository contains my personal website created for an assignment using GitHub Pages. The site introduces myself and highlights my interests and projects. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience with GitHub Pages, HTML, CSS, and web deployment.

## Website Structure

The website has a clear, easy-to-navigate structure with two main pages:

1. **Home Page (`index.html`)**: 
   - Includes a welcoming heading.
   - A brief introduction (minimum of 200 words) about myself or a topic I am passionate about.
   - An image relevant to the introduction.

2. **About/Details Page (`about.html`)**: 
   - Contains more detailed information (minimum of 200 words).
   - An image relevant to the topic.
   - A list (ordered or unordered) providing additional context or interests.
   - A smaller heading compared to the Home Page.

3. **Contact Section**: 
   - Includes links to my email or social media accounts.

4. **Navigation**: 
   - A header menu or links to enable easy navigation between the Home and About pages.

## Styling & Customization

Custom CSS was used to style the website and includes:

- Custom fonts and typography
- Color scheme changes for backgrounds, text, and links
- Adjustments to margins, padding, and layout for improved visual appeal

## Deployment

The website is published via GitHub Pages at: [https://diegobedoyach.github.io/my-website](https://diegobedoyach.github.io/my-website)
